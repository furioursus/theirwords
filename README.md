## Welcome to Their Words

This repo is a work-in-progress and a repository of **really, really offensive and triggering** words. It helps power [Their Words](https://theirwords.glitch.me). Seriously, if you have a problem seeing and reading racist/ableist/misogynist/queerphobic/etc. words and phrases, this repository is not for you.

### Why is this a thing?

I built this tool because I know a *lot* of us frequently have to weigh-in daily on whether or not a recent follow is someone you want hanging around your profile. Their Words lets you quickly access a Twitter advanced search query that hunts for these phrases. Again, you’ll potentially be exposed to lots of bad stuff on their profile if they’re being a shitheel online, so proceed to use it **with caution**.


### Support or Contact

If you have any problems with the tool, ping me at [@furioursus](https://www.twitter.com/furioursus) on Twitter! If you have suggestions for the terms file, submit a pull-request or let me know what you want to add.

#### Additional Terms

If you want to submite more terms for addition to the list, fork this repo, modify the `./terms.json` file and send me a pull request.
